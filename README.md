## Code Wars
[Code Wars][1] is a website that allows developers to train their skills by solving various mind-bogging tasks (or _katas_).

From now on, this will be the place where I post my solutions. They are commented and contain links to the original exercises. Sometimes I use somebody else's solution, if mine is significantly worse or uglier - I never use code I don't fully understand, though, and I try to implement others' algorithms myself rather than copying them.

I can already see the improvements that Code Wars has brought to my code and my mindset. I can't recommend it enough to anyone who is learning a new language or who simply wants to play a bit with a language already known.

### Kata categories
You can see all the katas I've completed on [my profile][2]. Here is just a summary to show you how many katas I've completed from the different categories. Please note that the categories are entirely made up by me and not any offical kata groups.

| Haskell Specific Kata | Number Kata | String Kata | Combinatorics kata |
| :-------------------: | :---------: | :---------: | :----------------: |
| 3                     | 3           | 7           | 3                  |

### Current Progress
 You can see my current progress on the banner at the bottom. It will be always up-to-date. For more stats, you can click it and see my profile on Code Wars.
 Be sure to ally me - I just started learning Haskell and I'd love to speak with some skilled Haskellers; or just to meet new friends!
