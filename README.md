## Code Wars
[Code Wars][1] is a website that allows developers to train their skills by solving various mind-bogging tasks (or _katas_).

From now on, this will be the place where I post my solutions. They are commented and contain links to the original exercises. Sometimes I use somebody else's solution, if mine is significantly worse or uglier - I never use code I don't fully understand, though, and I try to implement others' algorithms myself rather than copying them.

### Current Progress
The lower the number the better (this system somehow reflects levels in karate).

| Overall | Haskell | Python | Swift|
| :-----: | :-----: | :----: | :---:|
| 4 kyu   | 4 kyu   | 5 kyu  | 8kyu |

 Be sure to add me on Code Wars ([profile link][2]) - I just started learning Haskell and I'd love to be in contact with some skilled people; or just to meet new friends!

### Kata categories
You can see all the completed katas on my [CW profile][2]. Here is just a summary, so you can see how many katas I've completed from the different categories.

| Haskell Specific | Number Algos | String Algos | Parsers & Ciphers |
| :--------------: | :----------: | :----------: | :---------------: |
| 2                | 4            | 4            | 4                 |
