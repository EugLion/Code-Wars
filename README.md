## Code Wars
[Code Wars][1] is a website that allows developers to train their skills by solving various mind-bogging tasks (or _katas_).

This is the place where I post my solutions of the katas I solve. They are commented and contain links to the exercises. Sometimes I use somebody else's solution, if mine is significantly worse or uglier - I never use code I don't fully understand, though, and I try to implement others' algorithms myself rather than copying them.

Whether you're also learning Haskell, or if you're already a professional Haskell developer, please ally me. I just started learning it and I'd love to speak with other Haskellers, find some inspiration and meet new friends!

## Current progress &nbsp;&nbsp; [![EugLion's profile on Code Wars][3]][2]
 You can see my current kyu on the banner above. It will be always up-to-date. For more stats, you can click it and look at my profile on Code Wars. Here is just a summary to show you how many katas I've completed from the different categories. Please note that the categories are entirely made up by me and not any offical kata groups.

| Haskell Specific Kata | Number Kata | String Kata | Combinatorics kata |
| :-------------------: | :---------: | :---------: | :----------------: |
| 3                     | 3           | 7           | 3                  |
